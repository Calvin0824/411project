Our ideas are:

1) A dating application- users are matched based on information about their preferences, then recommended a place to go out which would incorporate public APIs. 

2) A community outreach volunteer app- users can find volunteer opportunities in their community based on their personal interests and strenghts. A section of the application can also allow people to post requests, aka things they are looking for help with in the community.
